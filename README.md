get third value = c;  
put all values into the quadratic formula in their correct positions;  
square b value under the square root equation;  
multiply 4 by the a value and c value;  
multiply a by 2;  
add the values under the square root;  
break down equation into two statements //one with plus and one with minus for the plus-minus;  
solve the square root value;  
For the first statement: add the b value to the new square root;
