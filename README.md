<h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
  <h4>Steps to solve a quadratic equation</h4>
  <body> check for three variables attached to each x</br>
- get first value = a</br>
* get second value = b</br>
* get third value = c</br>
* put all values into the quadratic formula in their correct positions</br>
* square b value under the square root equation</br>
* multiply 4 by the a value and c value</br>
* multiply a by 2</br>
* add the values under the square root</br>
* break down equation into two statements //one with plus and one with minus for the plus-minus</br>
* solve the square root value</br>
* For the first statement: add the b value to the new square root</br>
* Divide equation by the bottom value</br>
* For the second statement: subtract the new square root value from the b value</br>
* Divide equation by the bottom value</br>
* Print both results</br>
